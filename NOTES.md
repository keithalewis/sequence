# Notes

Pythagorean triples example.

BTW, m^2 - n^2, 2mn, m^2 + n^2 generate all triples.

|zw|^2 = |z|^2 |w|^2 where z = m + in, w = m - in.

Generate x <= y <= z filtered through x^2 + y^2 = z^2.

z | y <= z | x <= y <= z | where x^2 + y^2 = z^2

Prime number example.

2, rest not divisible by 2, rest not divisible by first of the rest..
